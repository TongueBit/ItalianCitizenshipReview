## About The Project

<a href="https://github.com/TongueBit/ItalianCitizenshipReview/issues">Italian Citizenship Review</a>
</br>
This app was created because of the 400 plus million people around the world eliible for Italian citizenship by ancestry, there is little transparency in the service providers who help facilitate the aqcuiring of citizenship.

I built the app with Java (SpringBoot, Hibernate, Thymeleaf, Maven) and MySQL. The front-end was built using Bootstrap. I implemented Spring Security as well. 

The app will continue to evolve, feedback, suggestions and bug reports are welcome.

## Getting Started

You can visit <a href="http://italiancitizenshipreview.com/">Italian Citizenship Review</a> to try the app online.

The homepage explains that this website is for finding service-providers for becoming an italian citizen with the best reputation.

You must register in order to leave a review. You will be sent a verification email. 

Once registered, you can leave a review for any service-provider. If the one you want doesn't exist, you can add a new one in the user dashboard section. All new service providers must be approved by an admin.


### Prerequisites

To run locally, you will need an IDE with Java 17 or higher.

You will also need a MySQL localhost on port 3306, and will need to edit the application.properties file to access your
localhost:
i.e.: "spring.datasource.username=" and "spring.datasource.password=" will need correct credentials for your localhost.

The app will automatically create a database at "spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/italiancitizenshipreview", unless
you create one named "italiancitizenshipreview" manually.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:TongueBit/ItalianCitizenshipReview.git
   ```
2. Import the repo to your IDE
3. Build and run the application
4. Open your web browser and go to:

  ```sh
   http://127.0.0.1:8080/
   ```

5. This will lead you to the homepage.
6. Register an account then login to leave a review.
7. If you want to create an admin, use sql to change ROLE to ROLE_ADMIN
